    <h1>Student 3: Uzumaki Naruto</h1>
    <p>Naruto Uzumaki (うずまきナルト, Uzumaki Naruto) is a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uzumaki clan. He became the jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails on the day of his birth — a fate that caused him to be shunned by most of Konoha throughout his childhood. After joining Team Kakashi, Naruto worked hard to gain the village's acknowledgement all the while chasing his dream to become Hokage. In the following years, through many hardships and ordeals, he became a capable ninja, regarded as a hero both by the villagers, and soon after, the rest of the world, becoming known as the Hero of the Hidden Leaf (木ノ葉隠れの英雄, Konohagakure no Eiyū, literally meaning: Hero of the Hidden Tree Leaves). He soon proved to be one of the main factors in winning the Fourth Shinobi World War, leading him to achieve his dream and become the village's Seventh Hokage (七代目火影, Nanadaime Hokage, literally meaning: Seventh Fire Shadow).</p>
     <p>Background:</p>
    <p>Naruto was born on the night of October 10th to Minato Namikaze (the Fourth Hokage) and Kushina Uzumaki (the second jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails). He was named after Naruto Musasabi, the protagonist of Jiraiya's first book, which made the Sannin his godfather.[14] The Third Hokage made special arrangements for Minato to preserve Kushina's seal containing the Nine-Tails while she gave birth to Naruto in a remote location, assisted by midwives and Anbu. A masked man, Tobi, tracked down their location, however, killed the midwives and Anbu, and captured Naruto, forcing Minato to quickly rescue him and teleport him to a safe house.

        With Minato gone, Tobi captured Kushina and released the Nine-Tails from her, using it to devastate Konoha.[15] Minato saved Kushina and left Naruto in her care before he went to protect the village,[16] eventually defeating Tobi and freeing the Nine-Tails from Tobi's control. Returning to Naruto and Kushina's location, Minato realised the only way to stop the Nine-Tails was to seal it within Naruto, believing that his son would someday need the fox's power to defeat Tobi when he returned.[17] Since the Nine-Tails' chakra was too immense to be sealed into an infant,<br><img src="./two tails.jpg" alt=""><br>Minato sacrificed his soul to split the fox's chakra in half, sealing the Yin half within himself and the Yang half within Naruto. After telling Naruto how much they loved him, Minato and Kushina succumbed to their wounds from protecting their son from the Nine-Tails and passed away.
        
        Orphaned, and not having anyone else to provide for him, Naruto received monthly income from the village in order to afford daily necessities. Naruto grew up not knowing who his parents were, receiving only his mother's surname, as Hiruzen wanted to protect Naruto from his father's enemies.[18] Minato's dying wish that Naruto be regarded as a hero was honoured by the very few who could put aside their pain and losses caused by the disaster, while the majority of Konoha, however having no knowledge of the circumstances surrounding his birth, openly ostracised and resented Naruto for containing the beast that devastated the village and took many lives; some even viewed Naruto as the Nine-Tails itself. Soon, the Third Hokage forbade anyone from mentioning the Nine-Tails, hoping that the younger generation would not blindly hate Naruto as their parents did.[19] However, Naruto's peers emulated their parents' hatred of him, despite not knowing why. This social isolation caused Naruto to crave acknowledgement, which he would gain by pulling pranks.

        On the day of his enrolment in the Ninja Academy[20] - Naruto first met Hinata Hyūga, who was being picked on by three bullies. Despite not knowing her, Naruto immediately came to her defence, but he was outnumbered and knocked unconscious, and the bullies damaged his red scarf. When Naruto awoke, Hinata thanked him for helping her and returned his scarf to him, but he let her keep it. He was unaware that the girl's growing affection for him began at that moment.[21]

        In the Academy, Naruto became a student of Iruka Umino, who acted as a surrogate older brother to keep him in line and help him work harder. Naruto also met his classmate Sasuke Uchiha and tried to befriend him, since Sasuke was alone as well. Jealous of Sasuke's skills and popularity, however,[22] he developed a one-sided rivalry in his pursuit to prove himself just as good as, if not better than, Sasuke, wishing that someday, Sasuke would accept him as an equal.[23] Naruto also grew close with the owner of Ramen Ichiraku, Teuchi and his daughter Ayame, being welcomed as their favourite customer.</p>
    <p>Abilities</p>
        <p>Originally, Naruto was a rather inept ninja, failing to graduate from the Academy three times. Through sheer determination and training however, his skills rapidly improved to defeat strong genin like Neji Hyūga, Gaara, and Kabuto Yakushi, earning acknowledgement from all the Sannin for his potential.[56] Under various tutelage, Naruto was able to defeat various members of Akatsuki, ultimately earning praise from Konohagakure as a Hokage-material hero.[57] Naruto's personally defeated various reincarnated Kage[58] and jinchūriki during the Fourth Shinobi World War,[59] with many believing he was the central key to winning the battle.[60][61][62] By adulthood, his prowess made him the Seventh Hokage, regarded as the strongest shinobi in history[63] and having command of overwhelming jutsu.[64] With the combined might of Sasuke Uchiha, noted as his only rival in power,[38] they are said to be able to destroy the world.[65] Together, they overpowered Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki who absorbed Kinshiki Ōtsutsuki, and pushed Jigen's body to its limit. Overall, he could compete against if not defeat world-threatening opponents, such as Obito Uchiha, Madara Uchiha, Kaguya Ōtsutsuki, and Toneri Ōtsutsuki, as well as fighting at his absolute peak managed to overwhelm Isshiki Ōtsutsuki.</p>
    <p>Chakra and Physical Prowess:</p>
        <p>As an Uzumaki and a reincarnation of Asura Ōtsutsuki,[66] Naruto has massive reserves of strong chakra. Even as a child, he had at least four times the amount of a seasoned Jōnin like Kakashi Hatake,[67] and described by Karin as "bright and warm".[68] Additionally, when Minato sealed Kurama within Naruto as an infant, he constructed the seal in a way that allowed a portion of the fox's immense chakra to naturally mix with Naruto's chakra over time.[69][70] His initial poor control of it was offset by his sheer reserves,[71] which were large enough to endure three and a half days of constant battle against several powerful opponents. Only by the end of his battle against Sasuke did he show exhaustion, and even then could still fight to a standstill and eventual victory.[72] Naruto's control improved greatly over time; able to transfer his chakra to others,[73] and perform one-handed hand seals.[74] Being an Uzumaki, Naruto's powerful life-force grants him an extreme longevity, healing power, stamina, and vitality;[75] this allowed him to survive the extraction of a tailed beast, though he required aid from Sakura Haruno to stay alive.[76] Naruto also learned how to counter genjutsu from Jiraiya, but his ability to do so is limited.[77] In adulthood, Naruto's chakra is powerful enough to intimidate Kawaki into submission[78] and destroy high-level barriers simply by releasing a burst of it.[79] He could repel Shikamaru Nara's Shadow Imitation Technique, a feat that no one else could do.[65] His chakra, when he combined it with his son's Vanishing Rasengan, turned it into a gigantic Ultra-Big Ball Rasengan able to kill the empowered Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki who tried to use a copy of the technique to defeat his.[80] His chakra reserves were also so vast that he was able to overload Delta's Absorbing Eye with a continuous Rasengan-assault and still primed to defeat her.[81]

            While naturally a short-range fighter, Naruto originally was inept at taijutsu, requiring unpredictable attacks to surprise combat experts like Kiba Inuzuka and Neji Hyūga.[82][83] He often utilised shadow clones in large if not massive numbers to simply overwhelm his foes.[84] Although these tactics resumed later, Naruto becomes much more adept at taijutsu due to Jiraiya's training.[85] After Fukasaku's tutelage, he could fend off a pair of expert kenjutsu users.[86][87][88] Two years after the war, Naruto's taijutsu prowess could best dozens of opponents without shadow clones or enhancements.[21] As Hokage, his taijutsu could pressure Momoshiki after he had absorbed Kinshiki Ōtsutsuki.[80] Naruto could even hold off Delta despite her extreme body modifications, ultimately controlling the pace of the battle to tire her out and gradually overwhelm her[89] to win despite being in the defensive.[81] His speed had also increased to the point where he could effortlessly catch up with Kawaki after he tried to escape from Naruto.[78] Likewise, in the anime, he is proven very resilient, able to take a point-blank blast from Kawaki's modifications unfazed.[90]

            After losing his right arm during his final battle with Sasuke, Tsunade cultured an artificial prosthesis for him using the cells of Hashirama Senju. As his body and the prosthesis arms are only connected through his chakra itself he can easily remove and replace them.[91] After Momoshiki's defeat, Naruto took inspiration from his chakra absorption technique and had Katasuke Tōno and the Scientific Ninja Weapons Team modifiy the arm further with mechanical features. With it, Naruto is able to neutralise and even absorb enemy techniques, though they have yet to replicate Momoshiki's ability to discharge them as a counterattack.[91]</p>

                In the Academy, the Sexy Technique was the only technique that Naruto could perform successfully, which had no practical use other than to shock people. Later, he learned more advanced and useful ninjutsu from Jiraiya. This included summoning toads from Mount Myōboku to assist him, and use them to crush enemies from above. He became skilled in shurikenjutsu, able to throw weapons quickly and with precision.[103] Naruto's repertoire expanded to fūinjutsu, where he could store his weapons within scrolls. His fūinjutsu was further increased upon receiving Gerotora near the start of the Fourth Shinobi World War.[104] In the anime, Jiraiya taught Naruto cooperation ninjutsu, combining his techniques with others to create an even more powerful one.[105] The collaboration techniques he performed with other individuals typically utilised his own elemental affinity, such as the Typhoon Water Vortex Technique with Yamato, the Wind Release: Toad Gun with Gamatatsu, and the Scorch Release: Halo Hurricane Jet Black Arrow Style Zero with Sasuke. He also learned from Asuma Sarutobi to flow chakra into his weapons to increase their offensive might.[106] In the anime, by adulthood, Naruto became able to use the Shuriken Shadow Clone Technique,[107] and also showed some proficiency with bōjutsu.[108]

                See also: Images of Naruto using Shadow Clone Technique
                Naruto's first trademark technique was the Shadow Clone Technique. While originally failing constantly with a basic illusionary clone, after briefly studying the Scroll of Seals, he learned to create shadow clones on a mass scale. From then on, Naruto's skill with shadow clones blossomed to great heights. Having unusually high chakra reserves, Naruto could use this technique to create hundreds of shadow clones and retain large amounts of chakra in each one with relative ease.[109] He could use them to outnumber or deceive his enemies, manoeuvre himself in mid-air, transform into weapons, scout areas, or test an opponent's abilities.[110] During his elemental-affinity training, learning that the original will gain all the knowledge and conditioning of a shadow clone right after it dispersed. From this, Naruto can use his mass scale of clones to drastically speed up his training to gain years worth of experience in just days. By the time he became Hokage, Naruto's usage of this technique on mass-scale and prolonged-periods allowed him to constantly perform multiple simultaneous tasks throughout the village daily, although he does have a tendency to overexert himself, leaving him exhausted afterwards.
                
                Rasengan:
                Naruto's Rasengan
                Naruto using the Rasengan.
                
                Naruto's second trademark technique is the Rasengan. Originally, due to his poor chakra control, Naruto had to use a shadow clone to form the spherical shape while he provided the chakra. Over time, Naruto developed larger versions of the Rasengan and learned how to perform it faster.[111] During the Fourth Shinobi World War, he learned to use the Rasengan and its variants unaided with a single hand, or even form one in both hands simultaneously.[112] He also increased the size of his standard Rasengan.[113] Naruto had also shown the ability to release the Rasengan as an energy wave,[21] or as a projectile in the anime.[114] Using senjutsu or Kurama's chakra, Naruto can create more powerful and elaborate variations of the Rasengan; using the latter, he even developed the Super Mini-Tailed Beast Ball, performing it in a similar manner to the Rasengan. In the anime, usage of his tailed beast chakra also allows him to instantly perform massive Rasengan without the aid of his hands and launch in quick successions, similar to a Tailed Beast Ball.[115]

    <br><img src="./naruto final.jpg" alt=""><br>
                
                Naruto's natural affinity is Wind Release. Using shadow clones, one to form the Rasengan while another infuses the Wind chakra, Naruto could complete difficult task of producing a Rasengan that is the pinnacle of shape and nature transformation, something no one before him could accomplish, including Kakashi and his father. Once adjusting to using the Wind Release: Rasengan he could expand upon it to produce the Wind Release: Rasenshuriken. He also created different-sized variations, and could even use two Rasenshuriken simultaneously. Two years after its creation, he became skilled enough to form a Rasenshuriken without any shadow clones and throw it in his base form,[21] a feat which he previously could only do while using his enhanced modes.
                
                After gaining the Six Paths Senjutsu, Naruto can utilise all basic five nature transformations, as well as Yin–Yang Release.[116] He could make perfect use of the latter to revitalise life-forces, heal whomever he touches, and restore missing organs.[117] After gaining chakra from the respective tailed beasts, Naruto can also use Shukaku's Magnet Release, Son Gokū's Lava Release, and Kokuō's Boil Release, able to infuse any of the other elements into is normal techniques as seamlessly as with Wind chakra. Having an arm made from Hashirama's cells, Naruto has a possibility to use Wood Release.[118]

                Naruto's Sage Mode.
                
                Naruto later trained in senjutsu at Mount Myōboku, which was only possible due to his high chakra reserves. Unlike Jiraiya, he was able to perfectly balance natural energy with his chakra, and enter a complete Sage Mode, symbolised by the orange pigmentation around his yellow eyes, his toad-like pupils, and no other alterations to his appearance. Using Sage Mode made Naruto's techniques stronger, enhanced his physical parameters,[119][120][121] utilise the Frog Kata taijutsu style,[122] and sense chakra through advanced enough to identify different signatures from vast distances.[123] Since Fukasaku was unable to fuse with Naruto and gather natural energy for him due to Kurama's interference, Naruto had to employ shadow clones instead to maintain the technique, taking advantage of the clones' own buildup of natural energy being transferred to the original and let him use Sage Mode a number of times. However, creating more than five shadow clones overall would disrupt the focus of the clones gathering natural energy. The need for this method diminishes over time as Naruto became capable of entering Sage Mode much faster.[124] However, after finding unity with Kurama, Naruto overcame this problem and learned to combine Sage Mode with Kurama's chakra to further enhance his abilities, such that he could resist Nagato's control and shatter Truth-Seeking Balls. In later years, having drawn experience from his various events, Naruto became able to maintain Sage Mode for much longer durations unaided.[125]
                
                Six Paths Senjutsu
                Main article: Six Paths Senjutsu
                Naruto also gained access to the Six Paths Senjutsu (六道仙術, Rikudō Senjutsu), which allows him to fly and also manifest up to nine Truth-Seeking Balls, composed of all five basic natures, use Yin–Yang Release, and imbue them with the Six Paths Chakra. He can mould the balls into a myriad of shapes, fire them as projectiles and still control them from distance, or convert them into Tailed Beast Balls and use them to create Tailed Beast Ball Rasenshurikens capable of destroying the planetoids generated from Chibaku Tensei. While his shadow clones are unable to produce Truth-Seeking Balls of their own, Naruto is able to transfer control of his own to any of his shadow clones.
                
                Six Paths Sage Mode:

                Naruto's SPSM
                Naruto's Six Paths Sage Mode.
                
                With the power given to him by Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki, Naruto gained access to the Six Paths Sage Mode (六道仙人モード, Rikudō Sennin Mōdo).[5] In this mode, his pupils take on a cross-like shape — without manifesting the orange pigmentation around his eyes present in Sage Mode. Going further, Naruto donned a new Nine-Tails Chakra Mode cloak, which he could access instantly and maintain much longer than his standard Sage Mode.[126] Naruto's physical attributes and techniques are further augmented,[127] to the point where he could dodge attacks that moved at the speed of light and deflect Truth-Seeking Balls. It also empowers his sensory abilities to the highest possible level,[128] which allowed him to sense the invisible shadows of Limbo.
                
                Asura Kurama Mode:
                Naruto's Asura Kurama Mode.
    <br><img src="./naruto baryan.jpg" alt=""><br>
                
                Naruto also retained use of his Tailed Beast Mode avatar of Kurama, which rivalled Sasuke's Rinnegan-empowered Complete Body — Susanoo in size and power.[129] Using two shadow clones, he could create and combine three Kurama avatars into a single construct with three faces and six arms, which is largely reminiscent of Asura's Six Paths: Kunitsukami.[130] This state allowed Naruto to infuse two massive Rasenshuriken with natural energy whose destructive capabilities rivalled that of Sasuke's most powerful jutsu, Indra's Arrow;[131] the resulting explosion from the two techniques colliding created an enormous cyclone that was visible from outer space.[132]
