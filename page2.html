    <h1>Student 1: Uchiha Sasuke</h1> 
    <p>Sasuke Uchiha (うちはサスケ, Uchiha Sasuke) is one of the last surviving members of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan. After his older brother, Itachi, slaughtered their clan, Sasuke made it his mission in life to avenge them by killing Itachi. He is added to Team 7 upon becoming a ninja, and, through competition with his rival and best friend, Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke starts developing his skills but eventually grows dissatisfied with his progress. He defects from Konoha so that he can acquire the strength needed to exact his revenge and master the Cursed Seal of Heaven. His years of seeking vengeance and the actions that followed became increasingly demanding, irrational, and isolated from others, leading him to be branded as an international criminal. After learning the truth of his brother's sacrifice, later proving instrumental in ending the Fourth Shinobi World War, and being happily redeemed by Naruto, Sasuke decides to return to Konoha and dedicate his life to help protect the village and its inhabitants, becoming referred to as the "Supporting Kage" , Sasaukage, literally meaning: Supporting Shadow</p>

    <p>Background:</p>
    <p>Sasuke is the second and youngest son of Mikoto and Fugaku Uchiha; they named him after Sasuke Sarutobi in the hopes that he would someday be just as strong of a shinobi.[10] Sasuke grew up in the shadow of his older brother, Itachi, a natural prodigy who many in the Uchiha clan and the village would constantly compare Sasuke and any of his accomplishments to. Sasuke himself adored Itachi, never passing up an opportunity to spend time with him. Although Itachi welcomed his company, letting Sasuke watch him train and taking him on adventures into the forests,[11] Itachi in return rarely helped Sasuke himself become a better shinobi; when asked, he would often instead poke Sasuke's forehead and promise to do so some other time. Sasuke found this annoying, but didn't allow it to blemish his high opinion of his brother.

        On entering the Konoha Ninja Academy, Sasuke proved to be the standout of his class, consistently getting top grades.[12] However, he could never meet the same milestones Itachi had set, resulting in their father paying Sasuke little attention.[13] Aware of this neglect, Itachi, despite being increasingly busy, tried to stand in for their father by giving Sasuke the recognition he craved, at times even blackmailing Fugaku to spend time with Sasuke. As time went on, Itachi started becoming distant with and cold towards their family, culminating in a falling out with much of the Uchiha clan on their suspicion that he'd killed his best friend, Shisui Uchiha. Sasuke did not understand the reason for this, but he didn't mind the side-effect: his father began taking an interest in his development. Fugaku taught Sasuke how to perform the Great Fireball Technique, which he mastered in a week.[14] Fugaku stated his pride in Sasuke for this accomplishment, but at the same time encouraged him not to follow in Itachi's footsteps.
        
        Uchiha Clan massacre
        Itachi spares Sasuke.
        
        After a long day of training, Sasuke returned home one night to find the streets littered with the bodies of the Uchiha. He rushed home to notify his family of this Uchiha Clan Massacre, only to find Itachi standing over the bodies of their parents. Sasuke tried to solicit help and comfort from Itachi, who responded by using Tsukuyomi on him to torment him with visions of him murdering their family. Horrified by what Itachi had done, Sasuke pleaded for an explanation, to which Itachi replied that it was to test his own power. Fearful that he would be next, Sasuke tried to run. Itachi cornered him and explained that Sasuke, as he then was, would not be worth killing. Only by becoming stronger, such as by acquiring his own Mangekyō Sharingan, could he prove a worthwhile challenge to Itachi's abilities. Before leaving, Itachi encouraged Sasuke to hate him, to desire revenge, and to gain power from that. Sasuke immediately followed through, pursuing Itachi and using his newly-awakened Sharingan to attack him. The attack failed and Sasuke passed out, but not before glimpsing Itachi crying; Sasuke would forget this had happened for many years.</p>
    <p>Abilities:</p>
        <p>Sasuke is recognised as a natural prodigy of the Uchiha clan, graduating at the top of his class in the Academy. He made a strong impression on Kakashi Hatake in the bell test, and could fight on par with strong shinobi, such as Haku and Gaara in Part I. After Orochimaru's tutelage for three years, Sasuke becomes strong enough to fight and even pressure Itachi, as well as the Fourth Raikage. With Six Paths Chakra and his Rinnegan, he is compared to the Sage of Six Paths by Kurama, and was able to help fight Madara who was the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki. Madara admitted he would have chosen Sasuke over Obito as an apprentice if he was born years earlier.[25]

            As an adult, despite losing his left arm, his performance has shown no impediment, as he fought on par with Kinshiki Ōtsutsuki. Ultimately, he is regarded as a legendary shinobi[26] that like Naruto, is referred to as the strongest shinobi ever,[27] with the Hokage viewing him as his only equal.[28] The pair's combined strength is thought to be able to destroy the world.[29] Likewise, together they could overpower Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki who absorbed Kinshiki Ōtsutsuki, something the other four Kage combined struggled against the former, and even pushed Jigen's body to its limit.
            
            Despite losing his Rinnegan, he remained a threat to Momoshiki,[30] and could slash Code's left eye.[31]</p>
    <p>Chakra and Physical Prowess:</p>
        <p>As an Uchiha, Sasuke's chakra is quite strong, and especially so due to being the reincarnation of Indra Ōtsutsuki. Whenever Sasuke's Curse of Hatred deepens, others remark how much stronger,[32] darker,[33] and more sinister his chakra becomes.[34] His reserves are also quite large, enough to use Chidori twice a day during Part I without aid. By Part II, Sasuke could use Chidori and other related techniques multiple times in a single day, as well as summon creatures as large as Manda. His chakra control is very high, though less refined than Sakura's. In the anime, he can perform hand seals between his and an enemy's hand.[35] In adulthood, he learned to use one-handed hand seals[36] and imbue materials with his chakra, skilfully manipulating its atomic structure.[37] Likewise, when thrown, he can control their trajectory[38] and sharpness.[39] He even learns to flow his chakra into wounds in order to purge poisons.[40]

            Sasuke is proven to be capable sensor.[41] During his final battle against Naruto, he sensed Naruto's build-up of chakra and natural energy from Kurama.[42] Also, in sharing half of Hagoromo's power with Naruto, he is also able to sense Naruto's chakra from a different dimension.[18]

            Sasuke is very skilled in taijutsu, able to hold his own in hand-to-hand combat against multiple opponents at once. His most consistent physical display is his speed and reflexes, which was further heightened by replicating Rock Lee's movements.[43] His speed is even shown to match, if not exceed various other fast techniques like the Shield of Sand[44] and Lightning Release Chakra Mode respectively, and enough to physically incapacitate opponents before they realise he's even approached them.[45] Between his increased speed and taijutsu prowess, it becomes very difficult for his opponents to find enough time to perform even a single hand seal.[35]
            
            Sakura, after re-encountering Sasuke for the first time in Part II, finds the improvement to his abilities unnaturally high and hypothesises that he was given drugs by Orochimaru. Orochimaru is known to have experimented on Sasuke, enough to make him immune to poisons.[46] Despite this, Sasuke remains vulnerable to particularly potent poisons, as his shadow clone was affected by Garashi Tōno's poisonous gas.[47] He was also affected by Menō's poisonous claws, with Sakura theorising that since the poison's ingredients were unique to the Land of Redaku, Sasuke's immunity was therefore meaningless.[48] He acquires some of Orochimaru's attributes after absorbing him, such as additional chakra reserves,[49] a faster healing rate,[50] and the ability to shed his body, all of which are lost when Orochimaru is removed from him. He later receives half of Hagoromo's power, which he evidently is able to keep.[51][52]</p>
    <p>Jutsu:</p>
        <p>Ninjutsu
            Sasuke learns to summon snakes during his time with Orochimaru. He typically summons them as shields, rapid ground transportation, or to bind targets. Unseen outside of the Animal Path, Sasuke can also summon a second animal species: hawks. His use of hawks is more limited than snakes, using them only for flight and the additional manoeuvrability that allows. By adulthood, Sasuke can use the Shadow Clone Technique, able to easily produce eight clones at once. While not a medical-nin he has capable skill in the Mystical Palm Technique, able to treat deep wounds and poisoning simultaneously.[53]
            
            Bukijutsu
            As an Uchiha, Sasuke is trained in a variety of different ninja tools. As a child, he once used (inexpertly) a bow and arrow to hunt a boar with Itachi,[54] practice that later becomes useful for his Susanoo. His area of expertise is shurikenjutsu, allowing him to throw shuriken and kunai with precision; for complicated or moving targets, Sasuke can guide shuriken to their mark using either wire strings or deflecting them off each other. In addition to remarkable natural speed and coordination for rapid usage, he also employs the Lightning Flash Blade Creation for even faster performance: by sealing shuriken and kunai into his arm bracelets, Sasuke has a large supply ready, allowing him to barrage targets in an instant.
            
            Sasuke's Sword

            Sasuke begins using a sword after training with Orochimaru, eventually becoming a master of Uchiha Style Kenjutsu. He wields it just as skillfully in either hand and compete against more experienced swordsmen,[55] quickly resheathing it after striking.[56][57] He can cut down multiple opponents in short periods of time.[58] He uses it defensively as well, blocking incoming projectiles;[59] By adulthood, Sasuke can instantly switch between wielding his sword backhanded and normally even during a clash,[18] was later able to slash Code's left eye, despite his power limiters being removed.</p>
    <p>Sharingan:</p>
        <p>Sharingan
            Sasuke's Sharingan
            Sasuke's Sharingan.
            
            Sasuke first awakened his Sharingan on the night of the Uchiha Clan Downfall, though he isn't able to do so again until several years later during his battle against Haku. Sasuke's Sharingan is especially potent, as Orochimaru noted that despite not being fully developed at the time, it was even stronger and greater in clarity than Itachi's.[69] Later, his prowess and skill with his fully matured dōjutsu earned him the nickname "Sasuke of the Sharingan" (写輪眼のサスケ, Sharingan no Sasuke).[8] With the Sharingan, Sasuke can see the flow of chakra, accurately reproduce any movement he sees (his own physical skill permitting), track fast-moving objects, and predict opponents' movement to a degree. He can also use Genjutsu: Sharingan for broad purposes such as distraction, interrogation, knocking targets out,[70] or placing them under his control.[71] He can use his Sharingan to relay information to others or enter their subconscious, which in the case of jinchūriki allows him to suppress their tailed beasts.[34] His Sharingan was also shown to be able to wipe people's memory's within a specific time gap.
            
            Mangekyō Sharingan
            Sasuke's Mangekyo
            Sasuke's Mangekyō Sharingan.
            
            Sasuke awakens his Mangekyō Sharingan after Itachi's death, once he comes to terms with the fact that Itachi did love him and was the single most significant relationship he had. Its design gives the appearance of three intersecting ellipses. Despite greatly augmenting his dōjutsu powers and access to new, additional techniques, it came at the cost of quickly exhausting him as well as straining his health. After Sasuke's excessive and regular usage of his Mangekyō almost completely deteriorates his eyesight, Sasuke had Obito transplant Itachi's eyes to gain the "eternal" Mangekyō, just before the start of the Fourth Shinobi World War. The transplanted eyes resemble a cross between Sasuke's and Itachi's Mangekyō while also a granting Sasuke tremendously improved performance: His chakra drain is reduced considerably while causing no strain to his physical health or sight from extended usage. Likewise, his Eternal Mangekyō is a rare "straight tomoe" (直巴, Choku Tomoe) type, granting him fluidity in his movements when fighting.[72]
            
            Sasuke's Eternal Mangekyo
            Sasuke's Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan.
            
            With either Mangekyō,[73][74] Sasuke can use Amaterasu, igniting whatever he looks at with black flames that can burn anything. With his right Mangekyō, he can use Kagutsuchi to shape the flames into a variety of forms and purposes, such as spikes to impale people. This ability to manipulate his Amaterasu makes him more skilled than Itachi was with his own.[75] Having awakened the Mangekyō in both his eyes, Sasuke can use Susanoo, a spectral warrior that protects him and acts on his behalf. While its original development was drawn from moments of intense rage, Sasuke became able to produce various portions of the spectre to serve his needs, such as ribs for defence or arms to interact with his surroundings. At higher development, he can layer musculature and skin over the bones, and later armour to increase its power. Ultimately, after gaining Six Paths Chakra, he can produce significantly larger Complete Body — Susanoo, comparable in size and power to Naruto's Tailed Beast Mode.
            
            Sasuke's Susanoo
            Sasuke's Complete Body — Susanoo.
            
            Like all Susanoo, Sasuke's has two swords at its disposal that it can use against larger targets or to easily destroy nearby structures. More commonly, his Susanoo employs a bow that can fire arrows at rapid speeds and, when needed, double as a shield. The arrows can be fashioned from the same chakra as Susanoo itself, Amaterasu's flames or,[76] channelling the tailed beasts' chakra, or lightning. From lightning, Sasuke can use his strongest attack, Indra's Arrow.[77] Susanoo can also be formed around the Nine-Tails in order to give it a sword and armour of its own,[78] and serve as a medium for his various techniques like Chidori.[79]
            
            Rinnegan
            Sasuke's Rinnegan

        <center></center><br><img src="./sasuke final.jpg" alt="height=350"width="290"><br><center></center>
            
            After receiving half of Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki's chakra as well as possibly being healed with Hashirama's cells, Sasuke awakened a Rinnegan in his left eye, with three tomoe on each of its two innermost circles.[80] However, should Sasuke's chakra reserves fall to a certain level, the tomoe vanish.[80] Unlike his lower dōjutsu, Sasuke's Rinnegan is apparently unable to revert to its original state. Despite this, it has no affect on his stamina or chakra levels. Likewise, Sasuke's Rinnegan can still access the techniques and abilities of his left Mangekyō.
            
            The dōjutsu gives Sasuke the ability of pattern recognition, being able to help him analyse patterns inside codes, and by comparing them to similar patterns, decipher writing.[81] It also grants him access to the various abilities of the Six Paths Techniques, such as forcibly attracting others towards him, trap individuals in the Chibaku Tensei through the Deva Path, and absorb chakra through the Preta Path. He can also use it to see invisible targets, repel the effects of the Infinite Tsukuyomi,[82] and turn his Susanoo into a vessel for the tailed beasts' chakra, much like the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path.[83]
            
            His signature (if not unique) Rinnegan ability is Space–Time Ninjutsu. With it, he can perceive distortions in the flow of time, see events that happen as normal, although it is unknown if he can negate the effects on himself.[84] With Amenotejikara, he can instantly swap places of any two targets in a specific range. In adulthood, his Space–Time Ninjutsu became advanced enough to travel through dimensions, even with others through inter-dimensional portals;[85] Upon Boruto Uzumaki stabbing it while being controlled by Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki, Sasuke lost his Rinnegan and its abilities.[86]</p>
