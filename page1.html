    <h1>Sensai : Hatake Kakashi</h1>
    <p>Early Life:</p>
    <p>Because his mother died when he was very young,[14] Kakashi was raised during his early years by his father, Sakumo. Sakumo was famed throughout the shinobi world, having saved Konoha on at least one occasion; Kakashi in particular revered his father. During one of Sakumo's missions - after Kakashi was enrolled in Konoha's Ninja Academy - Sakumo made the decision to save the lives of his teammates rather than complete the assignment. The mission's failure had disastrous consequences for the Land of Fire, causing many in Konoha, including the teammates he saved, to vilify him for abandoning his duties. Disgraced, Sakumo committed suicide. Seeing what his father went through and determined not to make the same mistakes, Kakashi decided that following the Shinobi Rules must always take priority.
        Kakashi Becomes Genin
        Kakashi becomes genin.
        In the Academy, Kakashi earned top grades, earning him recognition as a prodigy and the best of his generation.[16][4] Ultimately, he became very popular amongst his peers. With his talents soon being recognised, at age 5, Kakashi graduated from the Academy at the top of his class in a single year. Upon becoming genin, he and his classmates, Rin Nohara and Obito, were teamed together under the leadership of Minato Namikaze. In the anime, Minato gave the team a bell test at its formation, assigning the three to take the two bells he kept on his person. Minato often held back less against the prodigious Kakashi than with Rin and Obito so they couldn't obtain the bells without teamwork. Unfortunately, Kakashi realised this, only using Obito and Rin as a means to an end to obtain the bells. Nonetheless, Minato passed them because they accomplished the goal of the test by working as a team. Minato did encourage them to improve their teamwork afterwards, a message that Obito and Rin took to heart, but fell upon deaf ears with Kakashi.[17] Team Minato would go on many missions during its career, but Kakashi's devotion to the rules often made him difficult to work with;[18] Obito, already jealous of Kakashi's natural talent and popularity, was frequently at odds with him about this behaviour. At age 6, Konoha officials allowed Kakashi to compete in the Chūnin Exams with his team, which he passed by defeating Might Guy and became a chūnin.[19]</p>

    <p>Abilities:</p>
    <text class="align"></text><p>Kakashi is one of the strongest ninja Konoha ever produced. A prodigy with talent inherited from Konoha's White Fang,[46] he showcased highly advanced skill from a young age,[47] evidenced by his rapid rise through the ninja ranks.[48] His prowess is said to rival an entire country[49] and earned recognition on sight by various high-level ninja.[50] The S-Rank members of Akatsuki acknowledge his might;[51] he outmanoeuvred Itachi Uchiha (albeit he couldn't use his Mangekyō Sharingan at the time); fought Kisame Hoshigaki and Kakuzu to a standstill; and was deemed a major threat by Pain.[52] After Kaguya's defeat, Kakashi's combat prowess continued to increase, despite the loss of his Sharingan.[53] Against Koji Kashin, one of Kara's strongest Inners, Kakashi was able to pressure the foe into retreating.[54]

        In general, Kakashi is very versatile with advanced proficiency in countless areas including mastery of all three main ninja skills; Naruto Uzumaki says Kakashi is smarter than Shikamaru Nara, has a better sense of smell than Kiba Inuzuka, is more adept with the Sharingan than Sasuke Uchiha, and has better taijutsu skill than Rock Lee, each of whom are well-known for their high capacities in their respective areas.[55] Kakashi's genjutsu prowess is able to use basic techniques to major effect for intimidation and distraction.[53] Kakashi's combat and tactical prowess are so revered, that many foresaw his rise to Hokage status years before it happened.[56] However, the Sage of Six Paths believed Kakashi's greatest strength is as a teacher, leader, and friend, all of which proved vital in Kaguya Ōtsutsuki's defeat.[57]</p>
    <p>Chakra and Physical Prowess:</p>
    <p>Originally, by his own admission, Kakashi's chakra reserves were average. He could only use the Lightning Cutter four or Kamui three times per day. At the same time, he makes up for it with superb control, requiring no more than the minimum required amount to perform his technique, even able to do so with a single hand. However by Part II, Kakashi's reserves increased to a considerable size, shown when he used both techniques repeatedly during the final battle of the Fourth Great Shinobi war with only minor strain and exhaustion. In later years, his reserves allowed him to create and maintaining four collective massive walls for a few days and casually utilise his Purple Electricity numerous times.

        Kakashi's taijutsu can take various approaches in close combat. His time in the Anbu enables him to suddenly approach enemies from behind, unnoticed by even other Anbu.[58] Also, his ongoing competitions with Might Guy make him just as comfortable attacking from the front, striking with blazing speed and debilitating precision to quickly defeat multiple enemies. Kakashi is able to open at least one of the Eight Gates.[59] He has reflexes sharp enough to block attacks he is unable to see,[60] and has immense speed that allows him to perform hand seals at unreadable rates.[55]</p>
    <p>Jutsu:</p>
    <p>Kakashi primarily relies on his great skill and knowledge of ninjutsu. As an Academy Student, he excelled past his peers in ninjutsu, being able to use the Multiple Shadow Clone Technique.[61] Over the years, due in large part to his Sharingan, he gained a vast arsenal; reputed to have copied over a thousand techniques and which led to his moniker as "Copy Ninja Kakashi" (コピー忍者のカカシ, Kopī Ninja no Kakashi).[62] With this arsenal, combined with years of experience, Kakashi can handle almost any situation in various ways. He is also well-versed in fūinjutsu, impressing Orochimaru.[63] Many years after the Fourth Shinobi World War, Kakashi became skilled enough in Medical Ninjutsu to ease physical pain with a mere touch.[53]

        Kakashi has his own personal pack of ninken, which he raised since they were puppies; in the anime, he is shown using them during the Third Shinobi World War.[64] In the field, he can summon one or more of his ninken to fetch things for him, restrain targets,[65] or deliver messages. More commonly, he uses them for tracking, picking up trails, or seeking out targets he doesn't know where to look for.

        Kakashi is a highly skilled user of a wide variety of weapons such as bows and arrows, kusarigama, chains, and wire strings. Since childhood, Kakashi had highly proficient skill in kenjutsu, being able to wield his father's signature tantō effectively enough to be mistaken for Sakumo. Due to his background in the Anbu, Kakashi's swordsmanship was especially enhanced and he became very adaptable, being able to effectively utilise the Kubikiribōchō,[66] a uniquely shaped blade with noticeable size and weight, and being able to defeat kenjutsu experts such as the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist.[67] He can also enhance his physical tools, channelling lightning-nature chakra through them, gaining enough power to pierce and pass through large rocks.[68][69] He also has considerable skill in shurikenjutsu, being able to lash out at an opponent with a swift flurry of kunai and even effectively throw kunai with a well-placed kick.[70] Likewise in close range battles, he has great skill in this area, using weapons in his hands simultaneously. Against skilled melee combatants such as Zabuza and Hidan armed with their respective unique weapons, Kakashi can defend himself with a single kunai.
        
        Nature Transformation:
        Lightning Cutter
        Kakashi's signature technique, the Lightning Cutter.
        
        Kakashi can use all five basic nature transformations, as well as the Yin Release and Yang Release.[5] He can use Water Release without a nearby water source,[71] and is able to produce massive offensive, and defensive structures. With Earth Release, he can move underground for sneak attacks or produce multiple intricate walls to defend himself or large areas from attack.[72] Years after the Fourth Shinobi World War, Kakashi learned to convert his Earth Release techniques into quartz. Improving the quality of his techniques in this way negates its weakness to lightning-based nature attacks by absorbing and dissipating opposing techniques.[53] He is shown using Fire Release to launch a massive fireball.[73]
        
        Lightning Release Purple Electricity

        Kakashi's natural affinity is Lightning Release,[74] which he can channel into weaponry to increase its cutting power.[75] After failing to infuse the Rasengan with his lightning nature, he instead created the Chidori,[76] a collection of lightning chakra in the hand that can pierce most targets that it is thrust into; he once famously split a bolt of lightning with his Chidori, earning the name "Lightning Cutter".[77] He is able to block two of Kakuzu's Lightning Release: False Darkness with Lightning Cutter in each hand. However, it strains his arms.[78] Other techniques of this nature include lightning hounds that he can manipulate to attack with, lightning clones that paralyses opponents on contact,[79] and lightning cords that are even capable of cutting through Tailed Beast Chakra Arms. By his tenure as the Sixth Hokage, he created a new signature technique; the Lightning Release: Purple Electricity, which allows him to release a surge of purple lightning to produce a variety of effects: attack from afar, augment his physical strikes, and release a burst from all around him.</p>
    <p>Sharingan:</p>
        <p>Kakashi received his Sharingan during the Third Shinobi World War from Obito Uchiha, a replacement for the left eye he'd lost shortly beforehand. The Sharingan became his most identifying feature in the years since then, such that he is widely known as "Kakashi of the Sharingan" (写輪眼のカカシ, Sharingan no Kakashi). With the Sharingan, Kakashi can accurately reproduce any movement he sees (his own physical skill permitting), take in a heightened amount of visual information, and perform the Sharingan's broad category of genjutsu. Because he isn't an Uchiha, he can't deactivate the Sharingan and it rapidly drains his chakra whenever he uses it, leaving him bedridden after extended use;[80] as such, he keeps the eye covered when he doesn't need it in order to prevent this. Due to these challenges, Kakashi admitted that he hasn't mastered every aspect of the Sharingan,[81] something Kabuto Yakushi reiterates compared to a true Uchiha member.[82] Despite his handicap, he is still noted to have impressive prowess wielding it, as noted by both Itachi and Obito Uchiha.[83][84] Kakashi loses his Sharingan during the Fourth Shinobi World War to Madara Uchiha.[85] When Obito died with both his Sharingan, his spirit briefly returned from the afterlife and inhabited Kakashi's body, during which, Obito channelled both his eyes' dōjutsu power into Kakashi, granting full usage of their abilities. The loss of his Sharingan during the war resulted in him no longer using his signature Lightning Cutter, as the tunnel vision was no longer countered by the Sharingan.

            Mangekyō Sharingan

            Kakashi's Mangekyō Sharingan.
            
            Kakashi gained a Mangekyō Sharingan when Rin Nohara died.[23] Its design appears as three triangles wrapping themselves around the pupil, similar to a pinwheel. He was able to maintain it for over a decade, though he was steadily suffering its side-effects with each usage, such as bleeding eyes and deteriorating vision. With his left Mangekyō, Kakashi can use the long-range variant of Kamui: remotely forming a barrier around whatever he looks at to warp the target to Kamui's dimension; eventually, he learns how to send himself to the dimension and to a new location from it.[86] Kakashi initially had trouble to aim Kamui properly and hit his targets.[87] He improved to the point that he can use Kamui on fast-moving projectiles.[88] When he first starts using Kamui, it requires some amount of preparation and has a huge drain on his chakra each time it is performed. He also becomes able to perform it faster, enough that opponents may not even notice he used it at all.[89] However by around the end of the Fourth Shinobi World War, Kakashi admitted that he can only accurately use Kamui if close to the opponent due to his deteriorating eyesight from Mangekyō Sharingan overage.[90] <br>

 <br>After Kakashi loses his Sharingan, his body is temporarily inhabited by Obito's spirit, allowing him to use both of Obito's Mangekyō. In addition to the long-range Kamui he'd originally had, he becomes able to use its short-range variant, allowing him to make his body intangible so that attacks phase through him.[91] By combining this ability with his Lightning Cutter, Kakashi can bypass all defences and eliminate the possibility of being countered while attacking. Having a dual Mangekyō, Kakashi can manifest Susanoo, which has been honed into its "Complete Body" form. It can be used for flight, defend others with its large size, and even have the intangibility of Kamui extended to it. It can manifest either swords or shuriken to aid him in battle, the latter of which can produce Kamui Shuriken in order to warp away whatever they cut. In addition, Kakashi received some of the Six Paths Chakra.</p>
