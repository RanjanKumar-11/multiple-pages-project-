 <h1>Student 2: Haruno Sakura</h1>
 <p>Sakura Uchiha (うちはサクラ, Uchiha Sakura, née Haruno (春野)) is a kunoichi of Konohagakure. When assigned to Team 7, Sakura quickly finds herself ill-prepared for the duties of a shinobi. However, after training under the Sannin Tsunade, she overcomes this, and becomes recognised as one of the greatest medical-nin in the world.</p>
 <p>Background:</p>
 <p>Sakura is the only child of Kizashi and Mebuki Haruno. She had a healthy childhood, raised by her parents without any serious tragedy or complications, unlike her team members. When she entered Konoha's Academy, a few of the girls in her class started picking on her because of her broad forehead. Sakura tried to combat their teasing by hiding her forehead with her bangs, but this caused the girls to bully her even more. Ino Yamanaka, one of her classmates, saw this, and defended Sakura from her bullies and encouraged her to embrace her forehead rather than hide it.

    Over the following years, Ino's guidance and friendship helped Sakura become comfortable with herself and develop into her own person. Though she felt indebted to Ino for helping her, Sakura began to feel that she was living in Ino's shadow when she, instead, wanted to be Ino's equal. At some point after she entered in the Academy, Sakura met Sasuke Uchiha and she developed a crush on him. When she told her friends, she was surprised to learn how popular Sasuke was with the girls. Sakura heard a rumour of Sasuke being attracted to girls with long hair and she began letting her hair grow to get his attention. A couple of years later, when she learned Ino had a crush on Sasuke, Sakura ended their friendship so that they could compete for Sasuke's love, thus beginning a bitter rivalry between them and their dislike towards each other. After they were placed in their teams, Sakura approached Ino, bragging about being on Sasuke's team and declaring she won't lose.[10]</p>

<p>As a genin, due to her focus on her studies, Sakura lacked any particular combat skill, other than the basic skills she learned in the Academy. This greatly limited her role in missions, to the point where she frequently noted how much she relied on her teammates, Sasuke and Naruto. On one occasion, she is even stated by Shikamaru to be: "A kunoichi with no particular talent". Determined to change herself, she undergoes intense training with Tsunade for two-and-a-half years. From her display of skill in the earlier portions of Part II, others have remarked that Sakura would likely surpass Tsunade.[27][28] Upon completing the Strength of a Hundred Seal during the Fourth Shinobi World War, she's finally caught up to her team-mates at the time.[5] Two years later, she rises to the rank of jōnin,[29] and was capable of single-handily defeating Kido Tsumiki despite the Anbu being empowered by a Tailed Beast Drug.[30] As an adult, Boruto remarked that she was a suitable replacement for Naruto as Hokage.[31] <p>
<p>Chakra and Physical Prowess:</p>
<p>While Sakura has rarely been seen using taijutsu in Part I, she was able to hold her own against Ino, one of the top students in her class.[32][33] After Tsunade's training, Sakura's taijutsu improved to the point that she could easily destroy a number of Sasori's puppets.[34] As an adult, she could go toe to toe with a Mangekyō Sharingan wielding opponent like Shin Uchiha.[35]

    As seen in Part I, Sakura's most defining skill was her proficiency in chakra control.[36] Even as a genin, Sakura could greatly augment her speed by sending chakra to her feet, impressing both Naruto and Rock Lee.[37] Such exact use of her chakra allows her to perform a jutsu with maximum efficiency without wasting much chakra. Kakashi Hatake once noted that her aptitude is well-suited for genjutsu. While never actually seen using genjutsu, due to her affinity for it and her proficiency in chakra control, Kakashi taught her a method to deal with being caught in genjutsu that involves abruptly stopping the flow of chakra.[38] She's frequently been shown to quickly identify when genjutsu is being used,[39] and release herself or others from it.[40] By adulthood, genjutsu had little to no effect on her and she is able to break out of even some of the strongest ones with ease.[29]
    
    Training under Tsunade for over two years refined her already impressive chakra control, becoming a vital part to many of her abilities. By rapidly building up chakra and concentrating it into her fists or other body parts, it grants her what is commonly referred to as "monstrous strength".[27][41] After completing the Strength of a Hundred Seal, her attacks become strong enough to destroy buildings or upend the earth, increasing with greater input of chakra.[42] She could even damage Kaguya with a single blow, breaking off one of her horns.[43] She can also use this increase in strength to lift great mass or free herself from formidable constraints.[44][45] These feats have led to Hashirama praising her raw power as being even greater than Tsunade's.[46]
    
    Sakura can use the chakra built up in her hands to catch and repel incoming[47] Likewise, after anticipating an attack, she can send chakra throughout her entire body to nullify the damage of normally lethal blows.[48]

    Another goal of Tsunade's training was to increase Sakura's available chakra supply via completing the Strength of a Hundred Seal, which is something that took three years to accomplish.[46] In the anime, Tsunade explained that building up the seal substantially drains one of their chakra, making it dangerous to perform surgery or fight, but Sakura developed a way to divert a small portion of that built-up chakra back into her normal reserves.[49] When the seal is released, Sakura has access to all the accumulated chakra, and since she doesn't need to waste any of it on maintaining a youthful appearance like Tsunade does,[46] she's able to perform techniques on a much greater scale than she's normally able to.[50] She can also transfer this chakra to others.[51]
    
    Sakura's unique mastery of chakra manipulation has improved enough to roughly map out entire structures by channelling her chakra through inorganic materials. Doing so allows her to detect threats, traps, and hidden rooms.[52]</p>
<p>Jutsu:</p>
<p>Ninjutsu
    Sakura's Heals the Alliance:
    Sakura and Katsuyu heal the tired and injured.
    
    By the Fourth Shinobi World War, Sakura could use the Summoning Technique, and like Tsunade, summon the giant slug, Katsuyu. Noted to be incredibly impressive by Shizune, Sakura could have Katsuyu split apart and attach itself to others, Sakura could then remotely monitor many allies at once, healing and replenishing their chakra as needed.[53] Sakura could also use Earth, Water, Yin, and Yang Release.[5] By adulthood, she acquired Fire Release as well.[54] Sakura has also become skilled in the use of fūinjutsu. Upon contact, she can skilfully implant a cherry blossom-shaped seal on a target. On command, these seals release red chakra threads that completely restrict body movement.[55]
    
    Medical Ninjutsu:
    Poison Removal

    The major purpose of Tsunade's training was to teach Sakura medical ninjutsu, which demanded Sakura's refined chakra control and intelligence. Tsunade remarks that her proficiency for healing is exceptionally rare.[56] As such, Sakura can heal even the most fatal of injuries.[57] Even when heavily injured, Sakura demonstrated the ability to quickly heal herself to halt further blood loss, managing to do so with the weapon still lodged within her.[58][59] When dealing with an enemy with an extremely resistant body, she could combine her chakra-enhanced fists with her medical ninjutsu to heal the resulting damage from her strikes, eventually killing the affected cells from over-replication.[60] By releasing the Strength of a Hundred Seal, Sakura can put her body in a state in which it heals itself so that she doesn't need to stop to treat herself or even be fazed by injury.[61] In the anime, she could perform a highly difficult operation alone to regenerate a missing section of a person's body.[62]

    If healing proves ineffective, Sakura can make incisions in her patients to try and directly treat her patients' vital organs.[63] She can also cure those who have been poisoned by extracting the poison from their bodies, while simultaneously repairing the damage — something which even poison-experts like Chiyo cannot do. To ensure a complete recovery, Sakura can create an effective antidote after analysing the poison's contents, even for poisons that Sasori did not believe anyone but himself could make antidotes for.[64] After Kurama was removed from Naruto, during the war, Sakura was able to prevent Naruto's death by manually making his heart pump, as well as manually carrying out respiration via mouth to mouth resuscitation until they were able to reach Minato and eventually saved him. Two years after the war, she again saved Naruto from chakra deprivation, by pouring her own chakra into him and Kurama, which took her three days. Her medical expertise extends to more standard medicine as well, enabling her to perform autopsies and examine cells with a knowledge of genetics.[65] She was taught by Tsunade how to blend powerful fast-acting sleeping gas,[66] and was taught by Shizune on how to concoct poisons that, when coated on weapons, could debilitate or paralyse a person with a single scratch.[67] In the anime, Sakura even created her own version of Military Rations Pills, intended to have more medicinal purposes and be easier to consume. By the time of Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, she had also learned the Healing Power Alteration Technique (癒力変生の術, Yuryoku Hensei no Jutsu), although it is unknown what this entails.[68] After Naruto became Hokage, Sakura's skill with medical ninjutsu had been recognised to the point he made her the head of the medical department.</p>
